# Travel Copilot

**Live Demo:** [https://sderosiaux.github.io/travel-copilot/](https://sderosiaux.github.io/travel-copilot/)

Your AI-powered travel companion that helps you manage every aspect of your trips with ease.

## The Problem

Airline websites and apps are fundamentally broken. They're built around operational needs—selling tickets, managing bookings, and pushing ancillary revenue—rather than genuinely helping travelers navigate their journeys.

**The typical airline experience:**
- Fragmented information scattered across confirmation emails, PDFs, and app screens
- No proactive help when things go wrong (delays, cancellations, rebooking options)
- Zero awareness of your travel context (connecting flights, visa requirements, layover lounges)
- Generic experiences that ignore your history, preferences, and loyalty status
- Siloed data: your flight info doesn't talk to your hotel, car rental, or calendar

Travelers deserve better. They need a **copilot**, not another booking engine.

## The Vision

Travel Copilot reimagines the travel experience from the traveler's perspective. Instead of forcing users to hunt for information across multiple apps and emails, it brings everything together into a single, intelligent interface that:

- **Anticipates needs** before you ask (document expiry reminders, visa requirements, packing suggestions)
- **Provides alternatives** when disruptions happen, ranked by what matters to you
- **Understands context** across your entire journey, not just individual segments
- **Learns preferences** from your travel history to personalize recommendations
- **Serves the whole family** with profiles for each traveler's documents, preferences, and special needs

## What This Prototype Demonstrates

This is a functional prototype exploring what a traveler-first experience could look like:

- **Trip Dashboard** - All your trips in one place with smart timelines
- **Flight Tracking** - Real-time status with disruption alternatives
- **Document Wallet** - Passports, visas, loyalty programs, insurance
- **Family Profiles** - Travel preferences and special needs for each family member
- **Airport Guides** - Terminals, lounges, facilities, and navigation
- **Trip Briefings** - AI-generated pre-departure summaries with everything you need to know
- **Smart Packing** - Context-aware packing lists based on destination and trip type
- **Travel Tools** - Currency converter, timezone helper, emergency contacts

## The Opportunity

Airlines have all the data they need to build this experience. They know your itinerary, your status, your preferences, and your history. The question isn't capability—it's priority.

This prototype is an invitation to imagine what air travel could feel like if airlines truly put travelers first.
